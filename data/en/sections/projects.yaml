- name:  Endpoint Monitoring Using Wazuh- Host Intrusion Detection Systems
  logo: /images/sections/projects/ids.png
  role: Contributor, Researcher.
  timeline: "September 2023 - Present"
  repo: "https://github.com/makt96/"
  summary: Host Intrusion Detection Systems (HIDSs) are very important in protecting systems from potential attacks by actively monitoring for possible threats. This project is all about endpoint monitoring, or in other words - ways to monitor computers and other devices on a network to detect nefarious events, potential vulnerabilities, or even intrusions into our network! This means we are going to check out Windows and Linux event logs and how they can be used to track potential threats and problems. During our lab, we get some experience using a Host Intrusion Detection system and would be tasked with trying to find the malicious actor who is attempting to break into a Windows machine! Our project is involve figuring out what configuration file was tampered with on the server!.

- name: Business Email Compromise(BEC)- Detection Technique
  logo: /images/sections/projects/BIC.png
  role: Contributor, Researcher
  timeline: "September 2023"
  repo: "https://github.com/makt96/"
  summary: We've handled our own BEC situation, where a malicious actor has sent phishing emails to many of our employees, trying to trick them into sending hundreds of thousands of dollars. To stop this, we went to look at some potentially malicious emails and inspecting .pcap files to determine which emails are legitimate and which ones are fraudulent..
